Bugs
THE FONT PIXELS ARE HORRIBLE
The final spire sequence seems to skip and hang-up

  - Spire now has a boss revue sequence
MUSIC!!!

Hook up SFX

Add the Well

More Townies
  - Someone giving +SPD? (new stat, helps running, initiative, and lowers landscape spawn chance?)
    - Maybe a basic "Innkeeper" and then give max health to doctor and spd to inventor?
  - Choice of stats? (Only when TLK is over X?)
  - Thief/Gold?

Need to do some "winnable" testing (add some path-checking code?)

Need an actual message that leads the players on to CLUA.
